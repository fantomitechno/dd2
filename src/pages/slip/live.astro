    * Current rank is the rank they have right now, imagine Lars being at the
    start, he'll be displayed as 100th or something
  </span>
  <span> ** Last update from their plug-in </span>
  <i>
    btw, this website is kinda lying: I filter and hide everyone currently under
    30m and show only 100 players
